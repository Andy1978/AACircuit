# AACircuit
Draw circuits using ASCII

**WARNING: a lot of spaghetti code ahead**

This code was created in 2001-2004 when I teached Borland Delphi 3 myself.
It contains many, many global variables, unstructured and undoctumented procedural code and bad variable names.

AACircuit was previously released unter the "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE". In 2016 I decided to open it under the GPLv3.
Perhaps someone wants to fix it to work with Lazarus.

## old README.txt: ##

If you save as generic Ascii-circuit (.AAC) file, you still can edit the circuit, e.g. move components.

For the ASCII representation, use copy or "Save ASCII". Use a fixed pitch font in your news- or mailclient!

Library: every symbol has to be created for each of the four directions. Please send me bug fixes and/or new symbols!
