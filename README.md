# AACircuit
Draw circuits using ASCII

**WARNING: a lot of spaghetti code ahead**

This code was created in 2001-2004 when I teached Borland Delphi 3 myself.
It contains many, many global variables, unstructured and undocumented procedural code and bad variable names.

AACircuit was previously released unter the "THE BEER-WARE LICENSE". In 2016 I decided to open it under the GPLv3.
Perhaps someone wants to fix it to work with Lazarus.

## binaries ##

You'll find binaries as zip and an installer [here](http://tech-chat.de/download.php)

## Python clone ##

There is a [python clone on github](https://github.com/Blokkendoos/AACircuit)
which is probably in much better shape and was mentioned on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2021/04/29/ascii-schematic-diagrams/)

## Lazarus ##

There are also some Lazarus versions out there, have a look at the forks!

## old README.txt: ##

If you save as generic Ascii-circuit (.AAC) file, you still can edit the circuit, e.g. move components.

For the ASCII representation, use copy or "Save ASCII". Use a fixed pitch font in your news- or mailclient!

Library: every symbol has to be created for each of the four directions. Please send me bug fixes and/or new symbols!
